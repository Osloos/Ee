======

Earth Empires Non-Player-Country Project!

*Caveat: I developed this really quickly to get it going, and am now regretting that, as it's very disorganized; I will slowly be refactoring it to make it easier to use.

To Contribute!
----

Fork the project, using the fork button.

Then clone it locally, make changes, and push them to github.

When you're happy with them, create a pull request, and I'll merge in your changes after reviewing them. It would be better to make smaller changes at a time, so I can digest them ;-)
